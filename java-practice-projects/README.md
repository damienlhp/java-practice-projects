# 💻 Java Practice Projects

Welcome to my **Java Practice Projects** repository! 🎯  
These are small projects I’m currently working on as I continue learning Java. I will keep posting more projects here as I progress. This repository is meant to showcase my **learning journey**, from basic syntax to object-oriented programming and other core Java concepts.
